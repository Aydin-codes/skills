Description
Builder's reference for web/app/3D projects: free and open-source-first stack choices, assets with licences, repos to learn from, connectors, UI and anti-slop rules, and quality checks. Use when planning, building or polishing any site or app.
# Builder's toolkit
 
Reference and operating rules for building websites, web apps, mobile/desktop apps and 3D web experiences. Compiled Nov 2026. Prices, free tiers and maintenance status change: verify anything cost- or licence-critical before relying on it (Context7 or official docs/pricing pages).
 
Written for people who direct an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and others) rather than hand-writing every line. Aim for professional results, not generic AI output, and explain the architecture so the user can steer.
 
## How to use this skill
 
This skill tells the agent what exists (stacks, libraries, free assets, example repos) and how to check the work. For taste decisions (colour, type, layout direction) use a design skill such as design-studio (check my repositories for it) if available, then use this skill to build it.
 
At the start of a task:
1. Name the project type and pick the matching row in **Default stacks**. Say which row and why in one line.
2. List the assets the project needs and where each will come from (user-supplied first, then the free sources below). Ask the user for anything only they have: screenshots, logos, real content.
3. If the stack has an example repo below, read its relevant example or source before writing code (clone shallowly or fetch the file), and say which one you used.
4. Build, then run the **Quality gate**.
## Operating rules
 
1. **Plan in plain English first.** Before writing code, state the plan: stack, why each piece, data flow, what the user must supply. Name the concepts ("this is the back end", "this is an MCP tool") so the user learns the vocabulary. Wait for a go-ahead on anything expensive to redo.
2. **Real material beats generated.** Ask for a Figma file, screenshots of reference sites (Mobbin if connected), brand colours, logos, real copy, real data. If none exist, propose specific sources from this skill. Never ship placeholder images (`placehold.co`, lorem ipsum, fake screenshots, fake testimonials, invented numbers) as final.
3. **Use current docs.** Libraries change fast (Tailwind v4, Next.js, Three.js). If the Context7 connector is available, use it; otherwise check official docs before writing setup code. Don't guess APIs.
4. **Check licences** for every asset you add. Record it in `CREDITS.md` or `ASSETS.md`: name, source URL, licence, where used.
5. **Prefer boring, popular defaults** (below) unless the project needs otherwise. Fewer services = fewer failure points.
6. **Security and data:** never build auth or payments by hand; use a provider. Never commit secrets; use `.env` + `.env.example`. With student or personal data (e.g. school LMS data), default to read-only access, minimal data, the user's own account only, and flag privacy implications (COPPA/FERPA for US K-12).
7. **Check your work before calling it done** (see Quality gate).
8. **Explain trade-offs briefly** when choosing; one line each, not essays.
9. **Free and open source first.** Default to free, open-source tools and CC0/public-domain assets. Only suggest a paid service when no free option does the job; then label it **(paid)**, say why, and give the closest free alternative. If the user asks for paid options, list them separately at the end.

## UI and design
 
**Kits:** shadcn/ui (default; copy-paste React + Tailwind on Radix) · Radix UI / Headless UI (accessible primitives) · Magic UI, Aceternity UI (animated landing sections; use sparingly) · Tailwind Plus (paid official templates) · daisyUI · Mantine · MUI · Chakra.
**Icons:** Lucide (default), Phosphor, Heroicons, Tabler, Iconify (200k+ across sets; check each set's licence).
**Fonts:** Google Fonts, Fontshare (free, high quality), Adobe Fonts. Pair one display + one text face max.
**Colour:** Realtime Colors, Coolors; build a token scale (50–950) and semantic tokens (bg, fg, muted, accent, border, danger). Check contrast (WCAG AA 4.5:1 body text).
**Design tools:** Figma (connector + plugin available: read frames and tokens, implement exactly), Framer, Webflow, Spline (3D scenes for the web), Penpot, Canva.
**References:** Mobbin (real app screens; connector), Godly, Awwwards, Land-book, Dribbble, Figma Community.
 
**Anti-slop design rules:**
- One clear focal point per screen; real hierarchy (size, weight, spacing), not everything bold.
- Consistent spacing scale (4/8 px) and max ~2 radii values; restrained shadows.
- Specific copy: concrete nouns, numbers, the actual product. Delete any sentence that could describe any product.
- No gradient-blob hero + generic 3-card feature grid + emoji bullets by default. Start from a reference the user likes.
- Real screenshots/demos of the product beat illustrations.
- Motion should explain (state change, hierarchy, spatial continuity), 150–300 ms for UI, respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Dark mode via tokens, not by inverting colours.
- Design mobile width (375 px) first; no horizontal scroll.
## Motion
 
GSAP (timelines, ScrollTrigger; free incl. plugins, own licence) · Motion (React, formerly Framer Motion) · Lottie / LottieFiles (After Effects exports) · Rive (interactive state-machine animations, mascots, buttons) · Anime.js · AutoAnimate (one-line list transitions) · React Native Reanimated (mobile) · View Transitions API (native page transitions).
 
## 3D on the web
 
**Libraries:** Three.js (core) · React Three Fiber + drei (helpers: cameras, loaders, Environment, Text, controls) · pmndrs/postprocessing (bloom, DoF, tone mapping) · Rapier (physics) · Babylon.js / PlayCanvas (full engines) · Needle Engine (Unity/Blender → web) · gltfjsx (model → React component) · Zustand (game state) · Howler.js (audio).
 
**Performance rules:**
- Use glTF/GLB. Compress with glTF-Transform (`gltf-transform optimize`): Draco or Meshopt geometry, KTX2/WebP textures, resize textures to what's visible (1k–2k usually).
- Budget: aim < 5 MB initial download for a page scene; lazy-load the rest. Show a loading state.
- Instance repeated objects; merge static meshes; bake lighting into textures where possible; cap device pixel ratio (`dpr={[1, 2]}`) and lower it on mobile/touch.
- Test on a mid-range phone/Chromebook, not just a desktop GPU. Handle WebGL context loss.
- Serve big assets from a CDN (Cloudflare R2, Vercel Blob) with long cache headers.
**Asset sources (check each item's licence):**
| Source | What | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Poly Haven | models, textures, HDRIs | CC0 |
| ambientCG | PBR materials | CC0 |
| Kenney | low-poly game kits, UI, audio | CC0 |
| Quaternius | low-poly characters, props, animation library | CC0 (some paid packs) |
| Poly Pizza | low-poly models | CC0 / CC-BY |
| Smithsonian 3D | scanned specimens and artefacts | many CC0 |
| NASA 3D Resources / NASA images | spacecraft, planets, imagery | generally free; no NASA logo or implied endorsement |
| NIH 3D, RCSB PDB (+ Mol* viewer) | molecules, proteins, anatomy | mostly free; check entry |
| Sketchfab | huge library, many free downloads | per model (CC-BY common: credit required) |
| Fab (Epic) | replaced Sketchfab Store + Unreal Marketplace (Oct 2024); Quixel Megascans | free + paid, Fab licence |
| TurboSquid, CGTrader | professional stock | paid (some free) |
| Unity Asset Store | Unity assets | per asset; many are Unity-only |
 
**AI 3D generators (drafts/props, clean up before hero use):** Meshy (free 100 credits/mo), Tripo (free 200 credits/mo but non-commercial; has auto-rigging), Rodin/Hyper3D, Tencent Hunyuan 3D, TRELLIS.2 (self-hosted, MIT). Free tiers are often non-commercial.
 
**Character animation:** Mixamo (free with Adobe ID, royalty-free; humanoids only) · Quaternius Universal Animation Library · AccuRIG (free rigging) / ActorCore (paid motions) · Rokoko, Move.ai, DeepMotion (mocap incl. from phone video) · Cascadeur (physics-assisted keyframing) · Blender (free, everything).
 
**How pros get 3D:** artists in Blender/Maya/ZBrush + Substance; marketplaces; photogrammetry/scans; motion capture; AI only for drafts. The agent cannot author production 3D art; it wires in, lights, optimises and animates assets the user supplies. If an asset is missing, propose 2–3 specific sources with licences, or a simple procedural/primitive stand-in clearly marked TODO.
 
## Images, video, audio
 
Photos: Unsplash, Pexels (free licences), Wikimedia Commons (per file), NASA Image Library (generally public domain); paid: Adobe Stock, Shutterstock, Getty. Illustration: unDraw, Storyset. Video: Pexels Videos, Mixkit (free); Artgrid, Storyblocks (paid); host with Mux or Cloudinary. Audio: Freesound (per sound, CC0/CC-BY), Pixabay Music, Kenney audio; Epidemic Sound, Artlist (paid). AI: Adobe Firefly (licensed training data), Midjourney, Ideogram (text in images), Runway / Google Veo (video), ElevenLabs (voice), Suno (music). For logos and main characters, recommend a human designer; AI output may not be copyrightable and looks generic.
 
## Code libraries worth knowing
 
Frameworks: Next.js, Astro, SvelteKit, React Router/Remix, Vite. Mobile/desktop: Expo, React Native, Flutter, Capacitor, Electron, Tauri. Data/state: TanStack Query, Zustand, Zod (validation), React Hook Form. Realtime: Socket.IO, Liveblocks (paid), Colyseus, Supabase Realtime. Charts: Recharts, Chart.js, D3. Content: KaTeX (maths), Tiptap (rich text), MDX. 2D games/physics: Phaser, Matter.js.
 
## Open-source repos to learn from
 
Not skills: real codebases and lists to read before building. Prefer reading a repo's `examples/`, docs or a relevant source file over guessing patterns. Stars and activity checked 3 Nov 2026.
 
**Learn patterns from code**
- `mrdoob/three.js`: the `examples/` folder is the best reference for any 3D feature (loaders, lighting, post-processing, controls).
- `pmndrs/react-three-fiber`, `pmndrs/drei`: idiomatic React 3D; drei source shows how helpers are built.
- `shadcn-ui/ui`: how accessible, clean components are structured (on `radix-ui/primitives`).
- `vercel/next.js`: the `examples/` folder has a working starter for almost every integration (auth, DBs, CMS, payments).
- `excalidraw/excalidraw`, `tldraw/tldraw`: polished, readable React + TypeScript apps (tldraw needs a licence key in production).
- `supabase/supabase`: `examples/` for auth, realtime and storage patterns.
- `motiondivision/motion`, `greensock/GSAP`: animation patterns (GSAP is free under its own licence, not OSI).
- `pmndrs/zustand`: small, readable state management.
- `modelcontextprotocol/servers`: reference MCP servers to copy structure from.
- `anthropics/skills`, `anthropics/claude-cookbooks`, `anthropics/claude-quickstarts`: skill format, agent and tool-use recipes, starter apps.
**Find free things**
- `sindresorhus/awesome`: index of awesome lists; search it for any topic (e.g. awesome-threejs, awesome-react-components).
- `ripienaar/free-for-dev`: free tiers of hosting, databases, email, monitoring.
- `public-apis/public-apis`: free APIs for project data.
- `punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers`, `hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code`: connectors, hooks, agents, skills.
**Learn concepts**
- `codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x`: rebuild tools to understand them.
- `kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap`: what to learn next for a role.
- `donnemartin/system-design-primer`: how apps scale.
- `freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp`, `TheOdinProject/curriculum`: free curricula; good for first contributions.
When the user points to a repo or awesome list, read its README and pick only entries that are maintained (commits in the last 12 months), free, and fit the project; say which ones and why.
 
## Connectors and plugins to suggest
 
These are MCP connectors and plugins; availability depends on the tool. Check which are connected before relying on them; if a useful one isn't, tell the user how to add it in their tool (in Claude: Settings → Connectors).
- **Design:** Figma, Canva, Adobe for creativity, Mobbin, Webflow, Wonder.
- **Build/ship:** GitHub (attach repo), Vercel, Netlify, Render, Cloudflare, Context7 (current docs), Sentry, BrowserStack.
- **Data:** Supabase, Neon, PlanetScale, MongoDB Atlas, Airtable, Notion, Google Drive.
- **Business:** Stripe, Shopify, Clerk, Resend, Mailchimp, HubSpot, Sanity, WordPress.com, PostHog, Cloudinary.
- **AI/automation:** Hugging Face, ElevenLabs, Zapier, Linear.
- **Plugins/skills:** frontend-design, web-artifacts-builder, design-studio, dataviz (Anthropic); Figma plugin; Supabase plugin; audit-suite (design/UX/perf/a11y audits); A11y Enforcer (WCAG 2.2); React/React Native engineer skills (GSAP, Reanimated, Tailwind); github-repo-polish (README and repo page).
## MCP servers (quick model)
 
Client = the AI app; server = your code exposing **tools** (actions, e.g. `list_assignments`), **resources** (readable data) and **prompts** (templates). Transport: **stdio** (local) or **Streamable HTTP** (hosted, needs auth, typically OAuth). Test with MCP Inspector. Start read-only, minimal scopes, one user's own data; validate inputs with Zod/Pydantic; return concise structured results; write clear tool descriptions (they are the model's only guide).
 
## Quality gate (run before saying "done")
 
- Runs from a clean clone with the documented commands; `.env.example` complete; no secrets committed.
- Visual check: take screenshots (Playwright) at 375 px and 1440 px, light and dark; fix overflow, alignment, contrast, empty/loading/error states.
- Accessibility: keyboard-only pass, visible focus, labels/alt text, axe-core or Lighthouse a11y ≥ 90, `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured.
- Performance: Lighthouse performance on mobile; images sized and lazy-loaded; 3D assets compressed; no layout shift on load.
- SEO/sharing for public pages: title, meta description, Open Graph image, real 404 status, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`.
- No placeholder content, template leftovers or invented claims; `ASSETS.md` lists every third-party asset and licence.
- README follows github-repo-polish if the repo is public.
## Licence rules
 
CC0/public domain: use freely. CC-BY: credit the creator (CREDITS.md and in-app credits page). NC (non-commercial) or editorial-only: not in anything sold or monetised. AI tool free tiers: often non-commercial. Brand names/logos/characters (NASA, game IPs, College Board "AP"): no implied endorsement; follow their trademark guidelines. Code: check package licences (MIT/Apache/BSD fine; GPL/AGPL has obligations; some "free" libraries like GSAP use their own licence; tldraw needs a licence key in production).
 
## Paid options (only when asked or when no free option fits)
 
Mintlify (docs), Tailwind Plus (templates), Screen Studio / CleanShot X (screen recording), TurboSquid / Fab paid / ActorCore (3D and motion), Adobe Stock / Shutterstock / Getty, Epidemic Sound / Artlist, Midjourney / Runway / Adobe Firefly, Liveblocks, Algolia, Clerk and Supabase beyond free tiers, Vercel Pro. Always pair with the closest free alternative.
